<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file fifo16to64.vhd </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of dcfifo_mixed_widths megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design fifo16to64.vhd.  The design fifo16to64.vhd has a write-side depth of 256 words of 16 bits each. a read-side width of 64. The fifo is in show-ahead synchronous mode.  The data becomes available before 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read acknowledge. </P>
